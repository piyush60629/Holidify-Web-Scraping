# Holidify-Web-Scraping
In the Holidify web scraping project, my contributions primarily revolved around extracting and presenting user reviews from the Holidify website. Here's a brief explanation of my role:
1) Flask & Python: I employed Flask, a Python web framework, to set up the server-side components of the project. Python was instrumental in developing the web scraping script. This script was responsible for extracting user reviews and related data from the Holidify website.
2) HTML & CSS: I utilized HTML and CSS to create the website's structure and design. This involved crafting the layout, styling elements, and ensuring a responsive design for a seamless user experience.
